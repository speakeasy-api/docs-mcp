Add multi-provider agent eval support with OpenAI Codex as a second provider. Introduces `AgentProvider` interface, `--provider` CLI flag, MCP pre-flight verification, and cost/token tracking for Codex. Removes hardcoded system prompts from acmeauth fixtures and adds package.json dependency assertions.
